I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Institute for Policy Research](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu) at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu). I obtained my PhD from the [Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics](https://aae.wisc.edu) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu). 

I work on topics in economics of education, applied microeconomics, and development economics. Please check out my [CV](/_pages/cv.md) and [Reseach](/_pages/research.md) for more info!  

<!--I am a development economist with a focus on the economics of education. Most of my current work is on affirmative action policies in early childhood. For more on my work please see my [research](/_pages/research.md).-->
