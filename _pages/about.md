I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University. I obtained my PhD from the Department of [Ag and Applied Economics](https://aae.wisc.edu) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu). I work on topics in applied microeconomics, economics of education and development economics. Please check out my CV and Reseach for more info!  

<!--I am a development economist with a focus on the economics of education. Most of my current work is on affirmative action policies in early childhood. For more on my work please see my [research](/_pages/research.md).-->
