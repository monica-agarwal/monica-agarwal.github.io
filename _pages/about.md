Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD Candidate in the [Applied and Agricultural Economics Department](https://aae.wisc.edu) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu). 

I work on topics in development economics and economics of education. Most of my current work is on affirmative action policies in early childhood.

<!--I am a development economist with a focus on the economics of education. Most of my current work is on affirmative action policies in early childhood. For more on my work please see my [research](/_pages/research.md).-->



I am on the 2023-24 job market and will be available for interviews.
