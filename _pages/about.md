Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD Candidate in the [Applied and Agricultrual Economics Department](https://aae.wisc.edu) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu). 

I am a *development economist* with a focus on the *economics of education*. I work primarily on affirmative action policies in early childhood. 

I am on the 2023-24 job market and will be availble for interviews.
