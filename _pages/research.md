**Job Market Paper**
- **Role of Affirmative Action in Enrollment, Test Scores and School Quality: Evidence from India** (*draft coming soon*)
    <p style="font-size: 85%; font-family:Verdana; width=80%;"> <strong style="font-size:90%; color:midnightblue;">Abstract:</strong> Worldwide, affirmative action policies are implemented as a means to promote social equity. India's Right to Education Act (RTE), one of the largest affirmative action policies in the world mandates all private schools to reserve 25% of incoming seats at entry-level grades for low socioeconomic status students. Despite being in existence for more than a decade, the effectiveness of this policy remains largely understudied. In this paper, I estimate the causal impact of RTE's 25% quotas on children's learning outcomes using a combination of rich administrative and survey data in a large state in India. I leverage the lottery based allocation of oversubscribed schools to identify the causal impact of being a beneficiary under this policy. I find that the policy improves children's English test scores by .18 SD via beneficiaries attending better schools, and investing more time in educational activities. While the policy allocates children to private schools, there exists a large variation in the quality of private schools. Hence, I uncover the distribution of effects within the private sector, and find that higher quality private schools boost English test scores by .5-.7 SD, relative to lower quality private schools. My findings are from a context when all learning is remote, and suggest that private schools, especially the ones at the upper end of the quality distribution, do a better job at adapting to, and implementing remote educational technologies, and in doing so, they also enhance children's learning. </p>

- **Parental Investments and Sibling Spillover Effects of Affirmative Action Policies: Evidence from India**

    <p style="font-size: 85%; font-family:Verdana; width=80%;"> <strong style="font-size:90%; color:midnightblue;">Abstract:</strong> Affirmative action policies that are targeted to specific individuals may have unintended spillover effects. Typically, such spillover effects are absent from the cost-benefit analyses of affirmative action policies. In this paper, I estimate the sibling spillover effects of India's Right to Education Act policy. I combine the administrative data of applications to grade 1 private school admissions under the policy, along with survey data conducted with a sample of applicant households, where I collect detailed data on children's educational outcomes for both the applicants of the policy, and their siblings. Lottery based allocation of oversubscribed private schools leads to a randomization in whether the applicant child wins or loses the private school lottery. I compare educational outcomes of children who are siblings in the winning applicant households, relative to those who are siblings in the losing applicant households, by comparing households that are ex-ante similar in their likelihood of winning the private school lottery. I find that being in a household that has a winning applicant child negatively affects the likelihood of enrollment when the sibling is younger and of pre-school age (by 15 percentage points). This result is potentially driven by the availability of high-quality learning materials from the school attended by the older applicant child who won the lottery to private schools. Conversely, when the sibling is younger, but of primary school entry age, I find that the likelihood of enrollment for siblings increases by 11 percentage points in winning applicant households relative to losing applicant households. This result indicates that for children that are approaching school entry age, parents in winning households are less likely to delay their school enrollment. I find no differences in parental time and monetary investments across siblings in winning versus losing applicant households. The results highlight that affirmative action policies may have unintended consequences, beyond targeted individuals, and highlights the importance of considering these spillovers in the cost-benefit analysis of such policies.</p> 


- **Female Inheritance Rights and Household Sanitation** (with Md Moshi Ul Alam) (*Updated draft coming soon.*)

     <p style="font-size: 85%; font-family:Verdana; width=80%;"> <strong style="font-size:90%; color:midnightblue;">Abstract:</strong> Females derive greater benefits from in-house toilets than males. Given this, we estimate the causal impact of a policy that increased inheritance rights of females in India, on the presence of a toilet in their marital household. We estimate that the policy increased the probability of the presence of a toilet in the household a woman marries into, by at least 11 percentage points on average. Allowing for dynamic and heterogeneous treatment effects, we show that the average treatment effect is primarily driven by larger effects in states that adopted the policy later compared to early adopters. In addition, we find that the policy had the highest impact on the group of women who were the youngest at the time of policy implementation, thus having the longest exposure under the policy. Our results highlight that empowering females through inheritance rights and thus improving their within-household bargaining power can be a seemingly unrelated, yet effective policy tool for improving sanitation coverage in regions grappling with open-defecation problems.</p>
