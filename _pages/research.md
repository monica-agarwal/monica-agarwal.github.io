**Job Market Paper**
- **The Role of Affirmative Action in Enrollment, Test Scores, and School Quality: Evidence from India**
  [ [**SSRN ungated**] ](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4894456)
    <p style="font-size: 85%; font-family:Verdana; width=80%;"> <strong style="font-size:90%; color:midnightblue;">Abstract:</strong> Worldwide, affirmative action policies are implemented as a means to promote social equity. India's Right to Education Act (RTE), one of the largest affirmative action policies in the world, mandates all private schools to reserve 25% of incoming seats at entry-level grades for low socioeconomic status students. Despite being in existence for more than a decade, the effectiveness of this policy remains largely understudied. In this paper, I estimate the causal impact of RTE's 25% quotas on children's learning outcomes using a combination of rich administrative and survey data in a large state in India. I leverage the lottery based allocation of oversubscribed schools to identify the causal impact of being a beneficiary under this policy. I find that the policy improves children's English test scores by .18 SD via beneficiaries attending better schools, and investing more time in educational activities. While the policy allocates children to private schools, there exists a large variation in the quality of private schools. Hence, I uncover the distribution of effects within the private sector, and find that higher quality private schools boost English test scores by .5-.7 SD, relative to lower quality private schools. My findings are from a context when all learning is remote, and suggest that private schools, especially the ones at the upper end of the quality distribution, do a better job at adapting to, and implementing remote educational technologies, and in doing so, they also enhance children's learning. </p>

- **Parental Investments and Sibling Spillover Effects of Affirmative Action Policies: Evidence from India** (*draft coming soon*)

    <p style="font-size: 85%; font-family:Verdana; width=80%;"> <strong style="font-size:90%; color:midnightblue;">Abstract:</strong> This paper examines the sibling spillover effects of India’s Right to Education Act (RTE) during the period of COVID-19 induced school closures, focusing on the educational outcomes
of siblings of policy applicants. The RTE mandates all private schools to reserve 25% of the incoming seats in grade 1 for low socioeconomic status students. Using administrative data of households that applied under this policy and survey data on educational outcomes of applicant children and their siblings, I estimate the intent-to-treat effects (ITT) of being a sibling in a household where the applicant child won the grade 1 private school lottery. My findings indicate that younger siblings in winning households were less likely to be formally enrolled in school compared to their peers in losing households, but benefitted from increased access to remote learning resources provided by the older applicant child’s private school. Additionally, there were no significant differences in parental monetary and time investments between siblings in winning and losing households. This study shows that wellimplemented affirmative action policies during economic hardships, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can act as a safety net not only for the targeted individuals, but also benefit non-targeted individuals and can mitigate long-term educational inequalities.</p> 


- [**Women's Inheritance Rights and Household Sanitation**](https://moshialam.github.io/papers/Agarwal_Alam_sanitation.pdf) (with [Md Moshi Ul Alam](https://moshialam.github.io)) 

     <p style="font-size: 85%; font-family:Verdana; width=80%;"> <strong style="font-size:90%; color:midnightblue;">Abstract:</strong> Existing research indicates that females disproportionately benefit from having access to private toilets. However, lack of awareness regarding health-risks of improper sanitation, and limited intra-household decision-making power among females can be significant barriers to adopting toilets. In this paper, we study a novel link between household sanitation and policies that empower females. We estimate the causal impact of amendments to the Hindu Succession Act, which aimed to improve female property inheritance rights in India, on the presence of a toilet in their marital households using a difference-in-differences framework, and allowing for dynamic and heterogeneous treatment effects. Our findings show that the policy had a positive impact on the presence of a toilet in treated women’s marital households, with the effects being concentrated in the states that adopted the policy late. The effects are primarily concentrated for women who were relatively young at the time of policy amendment. We attribute our results on increased toilet coverage to the policy’s role in enhancing women’s years of educational attainment and weakly increasing their intrahousehold bargaining power. Our paper highlights that policies empowering women’s rights can have unintended benefits on their socioeconomic status and can effectively improve sanitation coverage in regions grappling with open-defecation issues. </p>
